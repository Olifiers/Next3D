- Further optimisations to the drawL2 Bresenham's, with self-modifying code for the colour
- Replaced a few calls with jp in drawL2
- Implemented the optimised trigL2 in asm (wireframe triangle drawing)
- TODO: Make a copy of drawL2 where trigL2 can modify the colour once and draw, without changing colour at the start of drawL2 (Optimisation)

Previous:
- New asm implementaion of Bresenham's draw, faster and simpler
Previous:
- This now includes the asm implementation of the Bresenham draw routine, as optimised as I can make it.
- Implemented filled trig in C
- Changed asm PlotPixel8K to use b as colour since drawLine needed d for deltax
